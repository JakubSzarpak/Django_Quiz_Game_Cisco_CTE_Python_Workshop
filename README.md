Quiz Game made during my Cisco CTE internship. For more info -> README.md

A quiz game made in Python that started with some simple requirements, but I spiced it up by running it inside a Docker container, adding a Django-based UI refurbished from one of my other projects, and connecting user–script communication through a PostgreSQL database.
